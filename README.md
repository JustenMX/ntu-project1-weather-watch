## Project overview

This project uses the API from data.gov.sg, specifically the NEA APIs, to fetch weather-related information and display it on the frontend dashboard. The end-users will be able to see all the related weather information based on the location defined in the search. They are also able to click on a specific location on the map to find out accurate weather information. Additionally, the project includes user CRUD functionalities where they can add multiple locations to their watch list. This allows them to have all the information based on the locations they have added to their watch list. Users can also delete locations or add new ones if required.

## Libraries Used

The project utilizes the following libraries:

- vite
- react
- react-router
- axios
- eslint
- uuid
- fortawesome
- leaflet
- toastify
- tailwindcss
- weather-icons

## Future Enhancements

In the future, the project will be improved with the following enhancements:

- [ ] Making the application mobile-responsive to ensure a seamless experience across devices.
